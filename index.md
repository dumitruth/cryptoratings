# The problem with current (financial) ratings 

The 2008 crisis was caused in part by ratings agencies 
Not truly independent -their revenue comes from the banks selling the instruments they were rating 

# Using blockchain to ensure objectivity, transparency and immutability
http://chainratings.org

# The proposed platform 
1. Double Sided marketplace
2. The client: Various types of Investors, Projects that want to certify their work  
3. The Raters: Open Source contributors
4. The rating algorithm
5. The reputation factor - using machine learning to evaluate Raters

# Focusing on rating blockchain projects 
While the proposed platform can extend to rating anything that needs objectivity, transparency and immutability, ChainRatings will start by focusing primarily on evaluating the codebase of Blockchain projects 

_**Why?**_
- Clear focus allows us to build the best real use-case product we can 
- Building a hub for Blockchain developers 
- Traditional methods for evaluating financial instruments not applicable to blockchain
- Codebase is arguably one of the strongest predictive features that is difficult to quantify by investors
